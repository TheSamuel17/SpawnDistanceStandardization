# SpawnDistanceStandardization

Some enemies spawn a little close for comfort, some spawn weirdly far and some can't make up their mind. This mod exists to fix that.

Default settings:
* Jellyfish are set to "Far" on every stage. This is the standard for them, but some stages (e.g. Helminth Hatchery) omit this, which makes them notably harder to react to.
* Magma & Overloading Worms are set to "Far" on every stage, because I don't like them spawning right underneath me. This is how they're handled in Rallypoint Delta.
* Beetles are set to "Standard" on every stage. This is for Wetland Aspect specifically, I don't know why they spawn extra far there.
* Children are set to "Standard" on every stage. This is for Shattered Abodes specifically, they also spawn extra far there and I don't always feel like chasing after them.
* Gups are set to "Far" on every stage, to combat their very short and sudden spawning animation.
* Larvae are set to "Far" on every stage, because fuck them.

Configs will let you adjust the settings for just about anything that can spawn in the game.

## Mod Compatibility & Recommendations

Enemies with the "Far" setting have a tendency to idle about, because they will often end up out of sight. To combat this, I recommend [TweakAI](https://thunderstore.io/package/Nuxlar/TweakAI/) to allow them to path to you without incident. Besides, I think enemies targeting you more proactively is a neat change in general.
