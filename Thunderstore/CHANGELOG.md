## 1.0.2

- Configs now accept `EverythingElse` as an option, if you so desire. Note that the more specific configs will take precedence over `EverythingElse`.
- Default configs: added Blind Vermin & Scorch Worm to the "Standard" setting to account for a peculiarity with Reformed Altar.
- Default configs: removed Gup from the "Far" setting. I have come to dislike my gelatinous friends spawning so far out of reach, and I have since then settled for a more elegant way of dealing with The Jumpscare.

## 1.0.1

- Default configs: added Child to the "Standard" setting to account for a peculiarity with Shattered Abodes.

## 1.0.0

- Release.
